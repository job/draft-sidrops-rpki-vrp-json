    <section title="Introduction">
        <t>
                This document defines a base YANG [RFC6020] data module for export of
                RPKI [RFC6480] Validated ROA Prefix (VRP) information. Such export 
                functionality has emerged in several implementations of relaying party (RP)
                software, but was not previously standardized, resulting in loose
                coordination between implementers.
                
                This module establishes a simple and consistent interface for information
                export by RPs drawing from best practices observed in existing implementations.
        </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Export Model Design and Structure">
            <t>
                This section should explain why the specific elements have been chosen
                for export, and why the structure of roas block + prefix and 
                AS content is the most useful or widely used.
            </t>
        </section>

                <section title="RPKI VRP Export Module">
            <t>
                The YANG module itself goes here.

        <section title="Implementation status - RFC EDITOR: REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION">
            <t>
                This section records the status of known implementations of the
                protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of
                this Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in
                RFC7942. The description of implementations in this
                section is intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in
                progressing drafts to RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any
                individual implementation here does not imply endorsement by the
                IETF. Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the
                information presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors.
                This is not intended as, and must not be construed to be, a catalog
                of available implementations or their features. Readers are advised
                to note that other implementations may exist.
            </t>
            <t>
                The below table provides an overview (as of the moment of writing) of which vendors have produced implementation of inbound or outbound maximum prefix limits.
                Each table cell shows the applicable configuration keywords if the vendor implemented the feature.
