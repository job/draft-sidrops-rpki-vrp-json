                While <xref target="RFC4271" /> described methods to tear down BGP sessions or discard UPDATES after certain thresholds are exceeded, some nuances in this specification were missing resulting in inconsistencies between BGP implementations.

                        A BGP speaker MAY support the ability to impose a locally-configured, upper bound on the number of address prefixes the speaker is willing to accept from a neighbor (inbound maximum prefix limit) or send to a neighbor (outbound prefix limit).
                        The limit on the prefixes accepted from a neighbor can be applied before policy processing (Pre-Policy) or after policy processing (Post-Policy).
                        Outbound prefix limits MUST be measured after policy since the Policy (even a policy of "send all") is run before determining what can be sent.
                        When the upper bound is reached, the speaker, under control of local configuration, either:

                In <xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-model" /> in container 'prefix-limit', a leaf named "max-prefixes" exists.
                    The authors recommend the BGP Yang Model to be revised to contain the following leaves:
                <list style="hanging">
                    <t>max-prefixes-inbound-pre-policy</t>

                </list>
                    In addition to the above, the authors suggest that the BGP Yang Model is extended in such a way that per peer per AFI/SAFI pair an operator can specify whether to tear down the session or discard sending or receiving updates.

                                The pre-policy limit uses the number of NLRIs per Address Family Identifier (AFI) per Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI) as input into its threshold comparisons.
                                For example, when an operator configures the pre-policy limit for IPv4 Unicast to be 50 on a given EBGP session, and the other BGP speaker announces its 51st IPv4 Unicast NLRI, the session MUST be terminated.

                                Pre-policy limits are particularly useful to help dampen the effects of full table route leaks and memory exhaustion when the implementation stores rejected routes.

                                RFC4271 describes a Policy Information Base (PIB) that contains local policies that can be applied to the information in the Routing Information Base (RIB).
                                The post-policy limit uses the number of NLRIs per Address Family Identifier (AFI) per Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI), after application of the Import Policy as input into its threshold comparisons.
                                For example, when an operator configures the post-policy limit for IPv4 Unicast to be 50 on a given EBGP session, and the other BGP speaker announces a hundred IPv4 Unicast routes of which none are accepted as a result of the local import policy (and thus not considered for the Loc-RIB by the local BGP speaker), the session is not terminated.

                                Post-policy limits are useful to help prevent FIB exhaustion and prevent accidental BGP session teardown due to prefixes not accepted by policy anyway.

                                An operator MAY configure a BGP speaker to terminate its BGP session with a neighbor when the number of address prefixes to be advertised to that neighbor exceeds a locally configured post-policy upper limit.
                                The BGP speaker then MUST send the neighbor a NOTIFICATION message with the Error Code Cease and the Error Subcode "Threshold reached: Maximum Number of Prefixes Send". Implementations MAY support additional actions.
                                The Hard Cease action is defined in <xref target="RFC8538" />.

                                Reporting when thresholds have been exceeded is an implementation specific consideration, but SHOULD include methods such as Syslog <xref target="RFC5424"/>.
                                By definition, Outbound Maximum Prefix Limits are Post-Policy.

                                The Adj-RIBs-Out stores information selected by the local BGP speaker for advertisement to its neighbors.
                                The routing information stored in the Adj-RIBs-Out will be carried in the local BGP speaker's UPDATE messages and advertised to its neighbors <xref target="RFC4271">Section 3.2</xref>.
                                The Outbound Maximum Prefix Limit uses the number of NLRIs per Address Family Identifier (AFI) per Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI), after application of the Export Policy, as input into its threshold comparisons.
                                For example, when an operator configures the Outbound Maximum Prefix Limit for IPv4 Unicast to be 50 on a given EBGP session, and were about to announce its 51st IPv4 Unicast NLRI to the other BGP speaker as a result of the local export policy, the session MUST be terminated.

                                Outbound Maximum Prefix Limits are useful to help dampen the negative effects of a misconfiguration in local policy.
                                In many cases, it would be more desirable to tear down a BGP session rather than causing or propagating a route leak.
